# ABOUT THAT APP
Hi this is realtime chat application.I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sqlite3, Django technologies in this project. 
It has parts such as login, logout, contacts, profile, profile-update, chat, and if a message is seen, 2 symbols will appear, just like in Telegram, otherwise 1 symbol will appear. 
Of course, this project has notifications, if you receive a message, it will show how many messages have been sent to the contacts. So these are the main features, but there are many more features.
